## Demo electron react app.

Kept it simple. Have NOT used create-react-app as its too bulky for the requirement to avoid unnecessary configs.
Calls the REST API endpoint running on node to display a sample message.

## Setup

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the server with `npm run server`
- Start the react-electron desktop app with `npm run start`
- Creates a dist folder with mac installer with `npm run build`
